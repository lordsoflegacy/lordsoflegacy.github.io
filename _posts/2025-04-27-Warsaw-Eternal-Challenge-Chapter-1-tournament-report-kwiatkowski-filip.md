## Legacy scene in Poland

Warsaw is the capital of Poland, which means:

- we don't get as much of Legacy (or eternal) action as we would like;
- we are fortunately located relatively close to Bologna, Italy, thus we're able to travel there for [4seasons events](https://www.facebook.com/4seasonsBologna/) consistently.

Legacy has had its ups and downs in terms of active playerbase, but thanks to:

- [Filip PawÅ‚owski](https://nicefitt.wixsite.com/nicefit)'s Warsaw Eternal Challenge (which aims to consistently gather dozens of players for Premodern and Legacy tournaments),
- [Black Bordered Boomer](https://bbb.black/)'s (BBB) Challenge (which aims for the same, but adding Old School to the mix)

it (alongside at least Premodern) starts to see a sort of resurrection here. We (Polish players and tournament organizers) are not yet able to draw the attention and attendance of foreign players, but we certainly aim to get there sooner rather than later.

### Warsaw Legacy Challenge - Filip PawÅ‚owski's initiative

Taking place in rapidly growing and flourishing local game store (LGS) [CentrumMTG](https://www.centrum-mtg.com.pl/), Warsaw Eternal Challenge managed to gather 60 Premodern and 29 Legacy players. These numbers, at least according to gut feeling of many, are only to keep growing, perhaps even to double in the not-so-distant future.

I am going to focus only on the Legacy tournament going onwards.

### European Legacy Masters (ELM)

Stakes were risen up after it was announced that the winner will be granted an ELM spot. To some, it didn't matter (they either would go or wouldn't go to the hosting event anyway), but to others it was an additional reason to step up their game. One was for certain --- everyone would be playing their best, choosing the deck they are most likely to perform best with. This has an interesting consequence --- since in Legacy familiarity matters greatly, it's more likely for someone to pick a deck they _know_ rather than a top "meta" deck they are unfamiliar with.

This, paired with a relatively low number of players, meant that people who are knowledgeable about other's preferences may be way better prepared. Personally, I maybe expected a little bit more Show and Tells (there were only 2), but other than that, I feel like I managed to predict the meta quite well. 

## The tournament from the first-person perspective

From now on, I will focus on my first-person perspective on the tournament. We are going to go back to the more "objective" point of view [later in the article](#miscellaneous-things-trivia-oddities).

### Bans

It's worth mentioning that Legacy just faced some important bans recently. [`Sowing Mycospawn` and `Troll of Khazad-dÃ»m` were banned less than a month ago](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-announcement-march-31-2025). This, for me, was great news. Not because of any particular deck that I was playing --- summarizing it up by criminally constraining myself, I think Troll simply offered too great of a consistency to a very powerful game plan, and Mycospawn resulted in extremely anti-fun and anti-interactive play patterns<sup><sup>[just like one other historic card, albeit being a different kind of "anti-fun"](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/april-24-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-04-24)</sup></sup>.

So, despite not being certain what I was playing, I felt happy thanks to those bans.

### Past

It's worth noting that I have played very little Magic for the last 1.5 years. Occasionally I would show up at my friend's house to play a bit of mixed eternal formats, but that was it. I didn't have much free time. That has, fortunately, changed in April. I started attending local Legacy FNMs[^wednesday], and I've been doing [pretty][1] [okay][2] [there][3].

[^wednesday]: _Friday_ Night Magic, but hosted on Wednesdays.

### 8-cast

I have never really grown up to enjoy Delver strategies. Maybe it will change in time, but having started with ANT, migrated to TES, then to Death and Taxes (yeah), then, after a very long hiatus[^experience], to [Karn Echo](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/5055270#paper), I grew fond of... those kind of decks. Not delver decks.

[^experience]: In total, I have been playing Magic for around 13 years, 11 of which was Legacy. The aforementioned hiatus was like 2 or 3 years though. And it happened just when 8-cast became a thing.

Because of this, having experimented with Blue Painter (which I believe to be much worse than it seems), Red Painter (Goblin package or quit), I finally opted for 8-cast. [With `Clown Car`s instead of `Urza's Bauble`s](https://moxfield.com/decks/ogGe7IfcpUCYDx1zuGebeA).

Let's talk about some deckbuilding decisions:

1. `Clown Car` is, most of the time, better than `Urza's Bauble`
: Yes, Bauble draws cards and Car doesn't. But Car produces more artifacts and / or bigger threats. I feel like four `Mishra's Bauble`s is enough to fuel Emry. Numerous times I was enabled to make a powerful play thanks to the fact that Car produced extra artifacts. Those mainly involved employing `Metallic Rebuke`s.

2. `Metallic Rebuke` is great
: In my opinion, 8-cast rarely has explosive comebacks. Because of that, if I win a game, that is either because of an overwhelming start or a slow game with a decent threat backed up by countermagic. `Force of Will` is great, but it also poses Card disadvantage. Rebukes don't. Rebuke good.

3. I wish I played more `Memory Guardian`s
: `Memory Guardian` is great. I did not appreciate it at first. At least not to the point it deserves. It's cheap, it blocks big things (maybe not lategame-`Barrowgoyf`-level big, but still), flies over creatures to kill relevant planeswalkers, etc. And it cheaply fuels `Patchwork Automaton`, which, I think, is the core of the current iteration of the deck.

4. `Lavaspur Boots` make the deck almost to the level of `Patchwork Automaton` (or sometimes even more)
: You certainly are aware of the typical `Urza's Sage` ðŸ¡’ make 2 `Construct`s ðŸ¡’ get boots ðŸ¡’ swing for millions[^thrabenu]. But do you know how often can you play `Emry, Lurker of the Loch`, attach `Lavaspur Boots` to it, immediately get value, play second Emry, keep it, mill 4 more cards, reattach boots and get _even more value_?<br/><br/>Yes, this happened. During the tournament. More than once.

5. I'd love to have maybe one more `Metallic Rebuke`, maybe one more `Sink into Stupor`, maybe more `Memory Guardian`s, but I really liked having that many Saga targets in the maindeck
: And it does not feel bad to draw them. Well, at least not when it's the opening hand. Many decks will be irritated by the presence of T1 `Aether Spellbomb`. Many decks would attempt to `Wasteland` us, which T1 `Pithing Needle` stops. Or maybe you just know that your opponent plays `Sneak and Show` or relies on `Grindstone` and you just name that.<br/><br/>Those plays are especially powerful when deployed from T1 `Urza's Saga` (which paired with T2 `Ancient Tomb` becomes a great win condition on its own).

6. `Disruptor Flute` is great against `Show and Tell`-based decks, which I expected to face more than I actually did.
: It's just great. Sometimes it just stops `Sneak Attack`. Sometimes it makes `Show and Tell` cost 9 mana. Yes, this happened. During the tournament. More than once[^once].<br/><br/>I remember a Magic Online game where I had double Fluted on `Show and Tell`. The opponent, during their turn, cast `Echoing Truth` targeting one. We fought a counterwar, but I barely lost. It resolved. Then came the `Show and Tell`. Knowing that 1) if they simply put a creature, I win due to overwhelming board presence; 2) if they put `Omniscience` and cast Emrakul / Atraxa, I most likely lose, I decided to respond to it by recasting one Flute naming Atraxa. Then, thanks to `Show and Tell` resolving, I put the second Flute naming `Emrakul`. Opponent had put `Omniscience`. They conceded from the game.<br/><br/>Flute is also arguably decent against Nadu or other things like that. Maybe. Never faced it.


[^thrabenu]: First 3m40s of [this video](https://youtu.be/oSBiYT5gF8s?si=1T5BVpd7IaalBA6i).
[^once]: Okay, it actually happened _just once_ during the tournamnet, but it also happened during a Magic Online League (and since I played 3 in total, that frequency seems relevant), and during an FNM a week ago.

## Wrapping up

> So is 8-cast good / viable?

I don't know. I like playing it, and I feel like the deck offers some impressively powerful plays, but maybe I simply fail to differentiate between _truly powerful plays_ and _simply synergistic plays that most of the time barely get the job done_. You can't really compare the raw power of 8-cast to, e.g., UB Reanimator's. Even the best hands of 8-cast consisting of quick, grown Patchwork or a quick Kappa cannot even get close to land ðŸ¡’ `Lotus Petal` ðŸ¡’ `Entomb` for Atraxa or Archon ðŸ¡’ `Reanimate`.

But maybe I'm incorrect to look at it from this very perspective. Maybe, despite the aforementioned deck having access to so many cantrips, 8-cast, due to its cohesion of multidimensional synergistic cards, actually presents narrower variance. It sounds weird, but...

...but _I simply don't know_. I haven't played UB Reanimator seriously. I actually have played very little in the current meta --- at most a hundred matches. Maybe if I pick up a "more meta" deck I will suddenly have the same realization to when I switched from Karn Echo to 8-cast when it was still in its glory days. I thought "_wow, decks should be doing that much that well and that consistently?_".

But the deck felt good. I felt good playing it. I felt like I had a chance against pretty much any matchup, especially in longer games.

There are exceptions, of course. Because of the lack of traditional cantrips and "safe" card advantage, I don't feel comfortable playing against all-in combo decks such as Doomsday, Oops, or the nemesistic BG Shallow Grave. Nowadays, those decks are way more consistent than they used to. If I aggressively mulligan for counters, I feel like they can rebuild quicker, especially since mulliganing implies having access to fewer cards. If I don't, I usually end up with a possibly great-feeling hand that has a good mix of interaction and board presence. Then they just overpower me with just enough discard / protection and combo off anyway.

But maybe it's variance. Maybe it should not be like this, and in my experiences I have just been unlucky.

But, again, on the other hand, it may as well mean that I was simply lucky to win other matchups.
