## Legacy Scene in Poland

Warsaw is the capital of Poland, which means:

- we don't get as much Legacy (or Eternal) action as we would like;
- we are fortunately located relatively close to Bologna, Italy, so we're able to travel there regularly for [4seasons events](https://www.facebook.com/4seasonsBologna/).

Legacy has had its ups and downs in terms of its active player base, but thanks to:

- [Filip Paw≈Çowski](https://nicefitt.wixsite.com/nicefit)'s Warsaw Eternal Challenge (which aims to consistently gather dozens of players for Premodern and Legacy tournaments),
- [Black Bordered Boomer](https://bbb.black/)'s (BBB) Challenge (which aims for the same, but also including Old School in the mix)

it (alongside Premodern) is starting to see a resurgence here. We (Polish players and tournament organizers) are not yet able to draw the attention and attendance of foreign players, but we certainly aim to get there sooner rather than later.

### Warsaw Eternal Challenge - Filip Paw≈Çowski's Initiative

Taking place at the rapidly growing and flourishing local game store (LGS) [CentrumMTG](https://www.centrum-mtg.com.pl/), Warsaw Eternal Challenge managed to gather 40 Premodern and 29 Legacy players. These numbers, at least according to the shared gut feeling of many, are only to keep growing, perhaps even to double in the not-so-distant future.

From here on, I'll focus only on the Legacy tournament.

### European Legacy Masters (ELM)

The stakes were raised after it was announced that the winner will be granted an ELM spot. To some, it didn't matter (they either would or wouldn't have attended the hosting event regardless), but to others it was an additional reason to step up their game. One thing was certain---everyone would be playing their best, choosing the deck they are most likely to perform best with. This had an interesting consequence---since in Legacy familiarity with the format and its staples matters greatly, it's more likely for someone to pick a deck they _know_ rather than a top "meta" deck they are unfamiliar with.

This, paired with a relatively low number of players, meant that people who are knowledgeable about others' preferences may be much better prepared. Personally, I expected a little bit more Show and Tells (there were only 2), but other than that, I feel like I managed to predict the meta quite well. 

## The Tournament from the First-Person Perspective

From here on, I'll focus on my personal perspective of the tournament. We'll go back to a more objective point of view [later in the article](#the-winner).

### Bans

It's worth mentioning that Legacy has faced some important bans recently. [&#8288;<mtg-card>Sowing Mycospawn</mtg-card> and &#8288;<mtg-card>Troll of Khazad-d√ªm</mtg-card> were banned less than a month ago](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-announcement-march-31-2025). This, for me, was great news. Not because of any particular deck that I was playing---to summarize it (perhaps oversimplifying), I think the Troll simply offered too great of a consistency to a very powerful game plan, and Mycospawn led to extremely unfun and non-interactive play patterns<sup><sup>[just like one other historic card, albeit being a different kind of "anti-fun"](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/april-24-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-04-24)</sup></sup>.

So, despite not being certain which deck I would be playing, I felt happy thanks to those bans.

### My Experience

It's worth noting that I have played very little Magic for the last 1.5 years. Occasionally, I'd show up at my friend's house to play a bit of mixed Eternal formats, but that was it. I didn't have much free time. Fortunately, that changed in April. I started attending local Legacy FNMs[^wednesday], and I've been doing [pretty][1] [okay][2] [there][3].

[^wednesday]: _Friday_ Night Magic, but hosted on Wednesdays.

### 8-cast

I've never really come to enjoy Delver strategies. Maybe it will change in time, but having started with ANT, migrated to TES, then to Death and Taxes (yeah), then, after a very long hiatus[^experience], to [Karn Echo](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/5055270#paper), I grew fond of... those kinds of decks. Not Delver decks.

[^experience]: In total, I have been playing Magic for around 13 years, 11 of which was Legacy. The aforementioned hiatus was like 2 or 3 years though. And it happened just when 8-cast became a thing.

Because of this, having experimented with Blue Painter (which I believe to be much worse than it seems), Red Painter (Goblin package or quit), I finally opted for 8-cast. [Running &#8288;<mtg-card>Clown Car</mtg-card>s instead of &#8288;<mtg-card>Urza's Bauble</mtg-card>s](https://moxfield.com/decks/ogGe7IfcpUCYDx1zuGebeA).

Let's talk about some of my deckbuilding decisions:

&#8288;<mtg-card>Clown Car</mtg-card> is, most of the time, better than &#8288;<mtg-card>Urza's Bauble</mtg-card>.
: Yes, the Bauble draws cards and the Car doesn't. Paired with Emry, it becomes an engine that may be the sole reason a game becomes winnable at all. But the Car produces more artifacts and/or bigger threats. I feel like four &#8288;<mtg-card>Mishra's Bauble</mtg-card>s is enough to fuel Emry. Numerous times I was enabled to make a powerful play thanks to the fact that Car produced extra artifacts. Those mainly involved using &#8288;<mtg-card>Metallic Rebuke</mtg-card>s. But, on the other hand, it may be the case that 4--4 split between &#8288;<mtg-card>Clown Car</mtg-card> and &#8288;<mtg-card>Mishra's Bauble</mtg-card> should become an X--Y--4 split between &#8288;<mtg-card>Clown Car</mtg-card>, &#8288;<mtg-card>Urza's Bauble</mtg-card>, and &#8288;<mtg-card>Mishra's Bauble</mtg-card>. This would require more testing and fine-tuning.

&#8288;<mtg-card>Metallic Rebuke</mtg-card> is great.
: In my opinion, 8-cast rarely has explosive _comebacks_. It does have explosive _starts_, but rarely comebacks. Because of that, if I win a game, that is usually either because of an opponent-overwhelming start or a slow game with a decent threat backed up by countermagic. &#8288;<mtg-card>Force of Will</mtg-card> is great, but it also results in card disadvantage. Rebukes don't. Rebuke is good.

I wish I played more &#8288;<mtg-card>Memory Guardian</mtg-card>s.
: &#8288;<mtg-card>Memory Guardian</mtg-card> is great. I did not appreciate it at first. At least not to the point it deserves. It's cheap, it blocks big things (maybe not late-game &#8288;<mtg-card>Barrowgoyf</mtg-card>-level big, but still), flies over creatures to kill relevant planeswalkers, swings for last remaining points of damage once our opponents deal with our previous threats, etc. And it cheaply fuels &#8288;<mtg-card>Patchwork Automaton</mtg-card>, which, I think, is the card that makes the deck.

&#8288;<mtg-card>Lavaspur Boots</mtg-card> elevate the deck almost to the level matching &#8288;<mtg-card>Patchwork Automaton</mtg-card> (or sometimes even more).
: You certainly are aware of the typical &#8288;<mtg-card>Urza's Saga</mtg-card> ü°í make 2 &#8288;<mtg-card>Construct</mtg-card>s ü°í get boots ü°í swing for millions[^thrabenu]. But do you know how often you can play &#8288;<mtg-card>Emry, Lurker of the Loch</mtg-card>, attach &#8288;<mtg-card>Lavaspur Boots</mtg-card> to it, immediately get value, play second Emry, keep it, mill 4 more cards, reattach boots and get _even more value_?<br/><br/>Yes, this happened. During the tournament. More than once.

I'd love to have maybe one more &#8288;<mtg-card>Metallic Rebuke</mtg-card>, maybe one more &#8288;<mtg-card>Sink into Stupor</mtg-card>, maybe more &#8288;<mtg-card>Memory Guardian</mtg-card>s, but I really liked having that many Saga targets in the maindeck.
: And it does not feel bad to draw them. Well, at least not when it's the opening hand. Many decks struggle against T1 &#8288;<mtg-card>Aether Spellbomb</mtg-card>. Many decks would attempt to &#8288;<mtg-card>Wasteland</mtg-card> us, which T1 &#8288;<mtg-card>Pithing Needle</mtg-card> stops. Or maybe you simply know that your opponent plays Sneak and Show or relies on &#8288;<mtg-card>Grindstone</mtg-card> and you just name that.<br/><br/>Those plays are especially powerful when deployed with T1 &#8288;<mtg-card>Urza's Saga</mtg-card> (which paired with T2 &#8288;<mtg-card>Ancient Tomb</mtg-card> becomes a great win condition on its own).

&#8288;<mtg-card>Disruptor Flute</mtg-card> is great against &#8288;<mtg-card>Show and Tell</mtg-card>-based decks, which I expected to face more than I actually did.
: It's just amazing. Sometimes it just stops &#8288;<mtg-card>Sneak Attack</mtg-card>. Sometimes it makes &#8288;<mtg-card>Show and Tell</mtg-card> cost 9 mana. Yes, this happened. During the tournament. More than once[^once].<br/><br/>I remember a Magic Online game where I had double Fluted on &#8288;<mtg-card>Show and Tell</mtg-card>. The opponent, during their turn, cast &#8288;<mtg-card>Echoing Truth</mtg-card> targeting one. We fought a counterwar, but I barely lost. It resolved. Then came the &#8288;<mtg-card>Show and Tell</mtg-card>. Knowing that 1) if they simply put a creature, I win due to overwhelming board presence; 2) if they put &#8288;<mtg-card>Omniscience</mtg-card> and cast Emrakul / Atraxa, I most likely lose, I responded by recasting one Flute, naming Atraxa. Then, thanks to &#8288;<mtg-card>Show and Tell</mtg-card> resolving, I put the second Flute naming Emrakul. The Opponent put in &#8288;<mtg-card>Omniscience</mtg-card> and conceded the game.<br/><br/>Flute is also arguably decent against Nadu or other things like that. Maybe. Never faced it.

[^thrabenu]: First 3m40s of [this video](https://youtu.be/oSBiYT5gF8s?si=1T5BVpd7IaalBA6i).
[^once]: Okay, it actually happened _just once_ during the tournamnet, but it also happened during a Magic Online League (and since I played 3 in total, that frequency seems relevant), and during an FNM a week ago.

### Preparation

This is the moment where I lose all credibility---everything I've said thus far has been thought-out and honest, but experience matters, and I, unfortunately, do not have much of it. Prior to this tournament I have played, in total, 12 paper matches and 15 online matches with this iteration of 8-cast. This all spanned over a month. This is **very little**. So please, don't take this article as a guide---instead, treat it as a very personalized set of opinions.

I joined the [8-cast Discord](https://discord.gg/26GeYKYtM5) server and received great help, mainly from ItsSchwiftyTime. I pondered some ideas, reported some results, ~~stole~~borrowed some decklists, and practiced.

#### Local Events

With 8-cast, I managed to go $$ 4 - 0 $$, $$ 3 - 1 $$ and $$ 3 - 1 $$ in locals. Losing, twice, only to Cradle Control. It's a tough matchup. On one hand, I wish I could play more &#8288;<mtg-card>Dismember</mtg-card>s, but on the other, why devote that many sideboard slots to a matchup we're likely losing anyway.

I felt particularly good about playing against Show and Tell and BUG Beanstalk (other Beanstalk variances that have access to &#8288;<mtg-card>Wrath of the Skies</mtg-card> may be way more problematic, but such is life). I faced it a couple of times during local events, but, unfortunately, only once during the tournament.

#### Magic Online

I strongly believe that, at least regarding Legacy, playing on Magic Online is almost a necessity if one wants to step up their game to the highest level. Yes, there are some inconsistencies (some cards not being available, the meta skewing toward faster decks, etc.), but they are manageable.

Unfortunately, it comes with a cost. You need to buy or borrow cards. I opted for the latter. If you perform well enough, you may earn enough to actually buy them later on. It's a fair trade if you ask me.

### Swiss

The tournament began. It has officially started at 10:00 and was meant to span over five rounds + top 8. For now, I will focus on reporting my results, my thoughts, and interpreting my notes taken throughout the games.

_Clockwise, starting from top-left: Krzysiek Mazurek (UR Delver), Miko≈Çaj Wyspia≈Ñski (Mono U Jewel), Piotr Szejko (Cradle Control), and Arkadiusz Chojaczyk (Merfolk)_

It's worth mentioning that I skipped a crucial step in preparation---making a sideboard guide. I would definitely recommend having one. Nevertheless, having played for a couple of hours the previous day and having analyzed the meta, I felt decently prepared.

#### Round 1

UG Infect
: ~ Bartosz Litwin

I suspected my opponent to be on UG Infect, since I have played against him a couple of times during our Legacy FNMs. I was right.

##### Game 1

I won the die roll and kept a good hand with Saga and a bunch of countermagic. I figured that if I stop him from doing infect things, then Saga (especially with the help of &#8288;<mtg-card>Lavaspur Boots</mtg-card>) is going to win the game. I was right.

##### Game 2

My opponent lead with a colored mana source and cast &#8288;<mtg-card>Ponder</mtg-card>. I started with &#8288;<mtg-card>Urza's Saga</mtg-card>, once again. I think I also played Automaton on T1. Then they played &#8288;<mtg-card>Inkmoth Nexus</mtg-card>, threatening to fly over my construct. T2 I deployed &#8288;<mtg-card>Ancient Tomb</mtg-card> in preparation to make more creatures. I also cast and use &#8288;<mtg-card>Mishra's Bauble</mtg-card> to see that my opponent is about to draw a second Nexus. On their T3, they double &#8288;<mtg-card>Invigorate</mtg-card>d the animated Nexus and swung for 9 poison counters. I made some constructs, fetched &#8288;<mtg-card>Pithing Needle</mtg-card> with Saga's trigger and shut my opponent's Nexuses down. Then I kept attacking him and countering his &#8288;<mtg-card>Blighted Agent</mtg-card>s, which would've finished the game on his next turn.

#### Round 2

UR Delver
: ~ Krzysztof Mazurek

Krzysztof is a seasoned player against whom I battle for the top place in our [league](../Wyniki-Ligi-Sezon-0/). He has multiple international top 8s on his r√©sum√© and is a skilled, methodical player. Paired with the fact that he pilots a Tier 1 deck (albeit with a twist of &#8288;<mtg-card>Cori-Steel Cutter</mtg-card>[^cori]), I was especially worried about this match.

[^cori]: Which may either mean that it's a slightly weaker, or a slightly stronger build. Time will tell.

##### Game 1

I lost a die roll, but managed to overpower him with &#8288;<mtg-card>Urza's Saga</mtg-card>'s constructs paired with a &#8288;<mtg-card>Shadowspear</mtg-card>.

{: file="vs. UR Delver" .nolineno }

##### Game 2

I was on the play, but I couldn't establish a powerful board. I didn't get any &#8288;<mtg-card>Shadowspear</mtg-card>s because two of my &#8288;<mtg-card>Urza's Saga</mtg-card>s ate a &#8288;<mtg-card>Wasteland</mtg-card> each. Ultimately, I lost to a flying threat. Flipped &#8288;<mtg-card>Tamiyo, Seasoned Scholar</mtg-card> made me unable to race him, despite otherwise it being a real possibility.

This game took very long. We also both missed a &#8288;<mtg-card>Mishra's Bauble</mtg-card> trigger---one just after the other. I don't know if him being able to draw that card would've changed much---ditto for me.

- [ ] Game 2: Loss

##### Game 3

No changes to the sideboard. We had very little time to finish this round, and we didn't manage to do so. The match was a draw.

##### Current Result:

$$ 1 - 0 - 1 $$

#### Round 3

Sneak and Show
: ~ Sylwester Stru≈ºyna

I've known Sylwester for a couple of years. Once a dedicated Infect player, nowadays, he migrated towards &#8288;<mtg-card>Show and Tell</mtg-card> strategies. I faced and defeated him recently in our FNMs, and I had my &#8288;<mtg-card>Disruptor Flute</mtg-card>s ready in the sideboard, so I felt good about the matchup.

##### Game 1

I lost the die roll. However, I managed to T1 Saga into &#8288;<mtg-card>Pithing Needle</mtg-card> naming &#8288;<mtg-card>Sneak Attack</mtg-card> after his T1 that consisted of a land and two &#8288;<mtg-card>Lotus Petal</mtg-card>s. Saga, paired with some other fast mana (can't remember if it was &#8288;<mtg-card>Ancient Tomb</mtg-card> or some artifact-based mana) created constructs, found &#8288;<mtg-card>Lavaspur Boots</mtg-card> and swung for lethal.

```
{: file="vs. Sneak and Show" .nolineno }

##### Game 2

I kept a non-explosive hand, but one that can power through a longer game. I cast a single &#8288;<mtg-card>Patchwork Automaton</mtg-card> and because I had a slowly developing hand, I managed to rebuild after the opposing &#8288;<mtg-card>Meltdown</mtg-card> left me with zero permanents. My notes say "_counters + small stuff_." Turns out it's just enough to beat &#8288;<mtg-card>Show and Tell</mtg-card>s with 8-cast.

- [x] Game 2: Win

##### Current Result:

$$ 2 - 0 - 1 $$

#### Round 4

UB Reanimator
: ~ Tomasz "tomjab" Jab≈Ço≈Ñski

[Tomasz](https://mtgtop8.com/search?player=tomjab) is an excellent, even more seasoned player than my previous opponents. I approach this matchup a little differently than the one against [Krzysztof](#round-2), thinking that I will likely lose quite abruptly due to skill and deck difference. I was expecting a short match where I succumb to his plays. I couldn't have been more wrong.

##### Game 1

I lost the die roll and played a very, very long game 1 (around 30 minutes or so), throughout which I felt like I was barely keeping myself alive. We both went down to 8 life. I have &#8288;<mtg-card>Patchwork Automaton</mtg-card>, and he has a flipped Tamiyo, an &#8288;<mtg-card>Orcish Bowmasters</mtg-card> and a 3/3 orc army.

Eventually, I topdecked a &#8288;<mtg-card>Memory Guardian</mtg-card>, which, as I previously mentioned, did not use to feel particularly good. I was, once again, very wrong.

That card single-handedly stopped my opponent from trying to be aggressive and, suddenly, I could start pressuring him. It even made my opponent stop plusing Tamiyo in favor of buying back cantrips to dig for answers / bigger threats. He did not manage to achieve that goal. I won that game.

{: file="vs. UB Reanimator" .nolineno }

##### Game 2

The game was shorter, and my notes simply say "slow game, outvalued." Looking at the registered life total makes this particularly interesting:

|   Me   | Opponent |
|:------:|:--------:|
| ~~20~~ |    20    |
| ~~17~~ |          |
| ~~15~~ |          |
|   13   |          |

Which means that I somehow managed to heavily employ &#8288;<mtg-card>Ancient Tomb</mtg-card> and was hit by &#8288;<mtg-card>Orcish Bowmasters</mtg-card> once, before stabilizing and making my opponent concede. I remember him desperately digging for reanimation spell for either Atraxa or Archon, and once he finally found it and slammed it on the table, I showed him &#8288;<mtg-card>Faerie Macabre</mtg-card> that was present in my hand for a couple of turns.

- [x] Game 2: Win

##### Current Result:

#### Round 5

RUG Delver
: ~ Maciej "Fidzio" Fidzi≈Ñski

Maciej is my good friend with whom I'm part of the [Black Bordered Boomers](https://bbb.black/) group[^bbb-challenge-2]. To my surprise, we are paired on the first table, meaning that we are at the very top of the leaderboard. Because of this, we intentionally draw (ID) the match and await for the top 8.

[^bbb-challenge-2]: Stay tuned for our Challenge---Episode 2, where we are going to be hosting an Old School, Premodern, and Legacy tournaments, where among other prizes you can win dual lands! It's going to be organized during the second half of September 2025.

##### Final result after Swiss:

$$ 3 - 0 - 2 $$

### Top 8

[The top 8 meta](Warsaw-Eternal-Challenge-Chapter-1/) didn't seem that favorable to me, and, in my opinion, I am paired with the worst of any possible matchups from that mix during my first top 8 match.

![Top8](/assets/warsaw-eternal-challenge-report/img/top8.JPG){: width="835" height="730" .w-75 }
_Going left-to-right: Mariusz Krzywicki (Red Painter), Grzegorz "Dauthi" Jezierski (BG Shallow Grave), Wiktor Werner (UG Show and Tell), Tomasz "tomjab" Jab≈Ço≈Ñski (UB Reanimator), (<em>below</em>) Marcin Nowakowski (RUG Delver), (<em>up again</em>) Adam Gerwatowski (Nadu Combo), Filip Kwiatkowski (8-cast), and Maciej "Fidzio" Fidzi≈Ñski (RUG Delver)_

#### Quick loss to BG Shallow Grave

BG Shallow Grave
: ~ Grzegorz "Dauthi" Jezierski

My notes for each game say:

1. "Too much discard"
2. "T1 discard + combo"

That's it. That concludes my journey in this tournament with 8-cast. As for the sideboarding in this match, I believe I did the same configuration as with UB Reanimator, but I left &#8288;<mtg-card>Force of Will</mtg-card>s in. Something among those lines:

```diff
+2 Faerie Macabre
+2 Metallic Rebuke
+2 Flusterstorm
+1 Soul-Gudie Lantern
+1 Grafdigger's Cage
-4 Clown Car
-2 Kappa Cannoneer
-1 Pithing Needle
-1 Thought Monitor
```
{: file="vs. BG Shallow Grave" .nolineno }

Grzegorz is a great and versatile player. He plays in many formats, he plays many different decks and knows all of them pretty well. No shame in losing to him, especially given the matchup.

##### Final result:

Qualified for top 8 at seat #3, lost in the first round of it.

## Wrapping up

> So is 8-cast good / viable?

I don't know. I like playing it, and I feel like the deck offers some impressively powerful plays, but maybe I simply fail to differentiate between _truly powerful plays_ and _simply synergistic plays that most of the time barely get the job done_. You can't really compare the raw power of 8-cast to, e.g., UB Reanimator's. Even the best hands of 8-cast consisting of a quick, grown Patchwork or a quick Kappa cannot even get close to land ü°í &#8288;<mtg-card>Entomb</mtg-card> for Atraxa or Archon ü°í pass ü°í untap ü°í &#8288;<mtg-card>Reanimate</mtg-card>.

But maybe I'm incorrect to look at it from this very perspective. Maybe, despite the aforementioned deck having access to so many cantrips, 8-cast, due to its cohesion of multidimensional synergistic cards, actually presents narrower variance. It sounds weird, but...

...but _I simply don't know_. I haven't really played UB Reanimator. I actually have played very little in the current meta---at most a hundred matches. Maybe if I pick up a "more meta" deck, I will suddenly have the same realization to when I switched from Karn Echo to 8-cast when the latter was still in its glory days. I thought "_wow, decks should be doing that much that well and that consistently?_".

But the deck felt good. _I_ felt good playing it. I felt like I had a chance against pretty much any matchup, especially in longer games.

There are exceptions, of course. Because of the lack of traditional cantrips and "safe" card advantage, I don't feel comfortable playing against all-in combo decks such as Doomsday, Oops, or the nemesistic BG Shallow Grave (and Cradle Control...). Nowadays, those decks are way more consistent than they used to. If I aggressively mulligan for counters, I feel like they can rebuild quicker, especially since mulliganing implies having access to fewer cards. If I don't, I usually end up with a possibly great-feeling hand that has a good mix of interaction and board presence. Then they just overpower me with just enough discard / protection and combo off anyway.

But maybe it's variance. Maybe it should not be like this, and in my experiences I have just been unlucky.

But, again, on the other hand, it may as well mean that I was simply lucky to win other matchups.

### The players

It was great to see both relatively new and seasoned players. People come and go, but it's always sad to see dedicated players losing interest. That's why the presence of the format veterans was such a pleasurable experience.

### Miscellaneous things, trivia, oddities

Time for some interesting statistics, in no particular order.

#### The most commonly played card was &#8288;<mtg-card>Force of Will</mtg-card>

It has appeared 84 times in total. Based on the fact that we had 2272 registered cards in total, this means that &#8288;<mtg-card>Force of Will</mtg-card> has accounted for $$ 3.69\% $$ <sup>(nice)</sup> of all cards. The full top 7 most common card looks like this:

1. 84x &#8288;<mtg-card>Force of Will</mtg-card> ($$ 3.69\% $$)
2. 68x &#8288;<mtg-card>Brainstorm</mtg-card> ($$ 2.99\% $$)
3. 65x &#8288;<mtg-card>Ponder</mtg-card> ($$ 2.86\% $$)
4. 59x &#8288;<mtg-card>Wasteland</mtg-card> ($$ 2.59\% $$)
5. 47x &#8288;<mtg-card>Daze</mtg-card> ($$ 2.07\% $$)
6. 37x &#8288;<mtg-card>Polluted Delta</mtg-card> ($$ 1.63\% $$)
7. 37x &#8288;<mtg-card>Force of Negation</mtg-card> ($$ 1.63\% $$)

The reason why I opted for the uncommon number 7 for the top most common cards is that all of them are present in Delver-based (or historically Delver-derived) strategies. Given Delver-esque variants continuously proving to be the top tier of decks, this list clearly indicates which cards might be worth considering sleeving in.

The eighth card was a non-Delver-esque one. It was &#8288;<mtg-card>Ancient Tomb</mtg-card>, and with 37 copies it's tied with &#8288;<mtg-card>Polluted Delta</mtg-card> and &#8288;<mtg-card>Force of Negation</mtg-card> with $$ 1.63\% $$ presence.

It's not really worth to talk about the _least_ frequently occurring card, since:

1. the sample size (29 players) is very small
2. every now and then someone will register a fringe deck that nobody else has ever seen, which would usually imply that a given obscure card would be seen as _the rarest one-of_

#### There were only 2 &#8288;<mtg-card>Null Rod</mtg-card>s in total

Yeah. Just two. In Wiktor Werner's [UG Show and Tell](../Warsaw-Eternal-Challenge-Chapter-1/#ug-show-and-tell--wiktor-werner) and Grzegorz Janczewski's [UB Tempo](Warsaw-Eternal-Challenge-Chapter-1/#ub-tempo--grzegorz-janczewski).

Personally, I would expect more artifact hate from players. Maybe the presence of 8 &#8288;<mtg-card>Meltdown</mtg-card>s in total compensates for it, but that's up for interpretation.

#### There were 121 cards that were played as full playsets in "the 75"

## Spices

There was one fairly spicy list. Wiktor Werner's [UG Show and Tell](../Warsaw-Eternal-Challenge-Chapter-1/#ug-show-and-tell--wiktor-werner) played a single &#8288;<mtg-card>Eureka</mtg-card>, which is an uncommon sight. What's more, he played a full playset of &#8288;<mtg-card>Veil of Summer</mtg-card>! And that's alongside two copies of the newest addition to the deck --- &#8288;<mtg-card>Mistrise Village</mtg-card>. He really did _not_ want his stuff to get countered.

## Acknowledgements

This tournament would not have been possible without the extensive effort of the selected individuals and other representatives. I would like to personally thank:

- Filip Paw≈Çowski, for seeing this tournament to the end. From start to finish, he managed to plan, organize and coordinate the entire event. Legacy in Poland would not have been the same without you.
- CentrumMTG, for hosting the event in a concealed, yet approachable and cozy place. It's great to see what an amazing LGS you are becoming.
- MagicTown, for sponsoring some of the prizes and for supplying players with staples from Eternal formats.
- The ELM Team, for providing a slot for the most prestige Legacy event in Europe, or---perhaps---in the whole current world.

I'm sure many people share my appreciation for the aforementioned. You are doing a great job, everyone. Keep it up!
